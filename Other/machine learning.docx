---------- 6 step Machine Learning Framework: ----------
1. Problem definition
2. Data
3. Evaulation
4. Features
5. Modelling
6. Experiments

--------------------------------------------------------
1. Problem definition:
    What problem are we trying to solve?
    For example, Supervised, Unsupervised, Classification, Regression
2. Data:
    What kind of data do we have?
    Structured: CSV, JSON, xlsx, etc. 
    Unstructured: Image, voice
3. Evaulation:
    What defines success for us?
    For example:
        House data -> ML model -> House price -> Actual price
4. Features:
    What do we already know about the data?
5. Modelling:
    Based on our problem and data, what model should we use?
6. Experiments:
    How could we improve/ what can we try next?

---------- Main types of Machine Learning: ----------
    1. Supervised learning
    2. Unsupervised learning
    3. Transfer learning
    4. Reinforcement learning


---------- Main types of Supervised learning: ----------
    1. Classification -> Is this example one thing or another?
        1. Binary classification -> two options
        2. Multiclass classification -> more than two options
    
    2. Regression
        1. How much will this house sell for?
        2. How many people will buy this app?
    
---------- Matching your problem ----------
Supervised -> I know my inputs and outputs
Unsupervised -> I'm not sure of the outputs but I have inputs
Transfer -> I think my problem maybe similar to something else



---------- Data Science workflow: ----------
    -> Static data 
    -> Jupyter notebook 
    -> Data Analysis (Pandas) 
    -> Data Visualization (Matplotlib) 
    -> Machine learning model (Scikit-learn) 
    -> AI


---------- Different variable of data : ----------
For example:
1. Feature variable: (Weight, Heart Rate, Chest pain)
2. Target variable: (Heart Disease -> Yes/No)

Different Feature of data:
1. Numerical features -> (Weight, Heart Rate,Chest pain)
2. Categorical features -> Heart Disease


---------- Modelling: ----------
Three parts to modelling:
    1. Choosing and training a model -> Training Data
    2. Tuning a model -> Validation Data
    3. Model Comparison -> Test Data
